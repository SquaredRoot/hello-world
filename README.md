Hello world!


I disagree with Hubot, here's the list of top tacos in the Solar System:

1st) Mars: Olympus Tacos (Live Mons)
2nd) Earth: anywhere BUT Taco Bell, best in Mexico
3rd) Venus: any of the taco resturants, just don't get Super-Spicy-Sulfuric-Acid-Sauce. Will figuratively and literally burn your tongue off.
4th) Moon: meh. A little dusty 
5th) Pluto: Their tacos are frozen.
6th) Earth (Taco Bell): taste like ****.
